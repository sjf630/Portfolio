# Portfolio

## Description

This is the primary version of what will be my developing Portfolio.

The motivation for creating a portfolio is to practice the skills we've learned utilizing HTML and CSS in order to display and convey the work I have completed so far in my coding journey.

This challenge creates a working history of my advances in knowledge and understanding of basic coding skills in order to progress to other code languages.

Through this challenge, I learned that I continue to exhibit deficits in HTML and CSS that I am actively learning to deepen my fluidity with in order to advance through these languages.
